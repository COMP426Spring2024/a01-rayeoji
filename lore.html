                    African and Carribean Mythology
               </h2> 
              <p>Mami Wata, also known as Mother Water and La Sirene, is a traditionally female water spirit idolated in West, Central and Southern Africa as well as the rest of the Afro diaspora. Her lore is most commonly shared in: </p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Nigeria, especially in the Southeast</li>
                <li>Benin</li>
                <li>Ghana</li> 
                <li>Togo</li> 
                <li>The Carribean islands</li>
              </ul> 
              <p>She is often depicted as a mermaid or siren like figure with a human woman's torso and the lower body of a fish. As she is a marine spirit, Mami Wata is often associated not only with water but also water's metaphysical qualities such as beauty, sensuality, and a lack of control or restraint that is often depicted as sexual in nature. Acts of worship towards Mami Wata include leaving her fragrant or shiny offerings, as well as raucous partying and dancing until petitioners fall into a deep spiritual trance and eventually into a state of mental and/or sexual satisfaction.</p> 
              <p>Many stories surrounding Mami Wata also involve her taking on a fully human appearance to walk the Earth, especially during full moons or stormy nights. In some of these legends, Mami Wata is a righteous figure who acts as an avenger of female victims of violence at the hands of men. In others, she is an evil, seductive spirit whose sole mission is to lure unsuspecting humans, typically men, to their deaths beneath the waves. For the men she has sex with in her human form, legends of Mami Wata also detail her demanding complete fidelity from them in exchange for unimaginable wealth and success. Should they reveal their relationship to others, or God forbid share a bed with anyone else, Mami Wata's revenge is often swift with financial ruin, sickness and death. Other than being a cautionary tale to lustful or violent men, Mami Wata is also often used to scare young children into staying away from oceans or rivers for their protection. As such, she remains a prominent cultural figure in many African and diaspora households.</p>
